A mock Ecommerce web shop meant to simulate the shopping experience from a web shop such as Amazon. Features include a visually pleasing user interface, a shopping cart, a checkout page allowing users to enter in personal and payment information, and the sending of a confirmation email after a purchase.

## How it was made

**Languages Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript

**Tech Stack:** React.js, Commerce.js, Stripe

**Motivation:** The goal was to make a project to showcase my skills using React.js. I wanted to create something that I was familiar with and something that is used by many companies today. I figured that a web e-comerce web store would be a good choice.

**Challenges Faced:** The initial hurdle I had to overcome was learning React.js, which would be the foundation for this project. React.js was fundamentally different from any previous language or technology I had used previously so the learning process was challenging but also engaging. Other challenging parts include creating a visually appealing page as well as adjusting the syntax to match the latest version of material ui.

**Lessons Learned** Through working on this project, I demonstrated my ability to work with more advanced technologies such as React.js, which has diversified the skillset I have developed.
